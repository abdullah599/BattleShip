BATTLESHIP
Battleship is a strategy-type guessing game for two players.
It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) is marked.
The locations of the boats are concealed from the other players.
Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's boats.

Each ship must be placed horizontally or vertically across grid spaces (not diagonally) and the ships can't hang off the grid.
Ships can touch each other, but they can't occupy the same grid space.
You cannot change the position of the ships after the game begins.

How to play:
1)Click on play to start the game.
2)Press ENTER to start the game.
3)Place ships by arrow keys (you can also rotate them by pressing "R").
4)After setting up your ships, the computer will set up its ships.
5)Then you will guess where the computer has placed its ship.
